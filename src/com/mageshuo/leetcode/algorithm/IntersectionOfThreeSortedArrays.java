 Given three integer arrays arr1, arr2 and arr3 sorted in strictly increasing order, return a sorted array of only the integers that appeared in all three arrays.



 Example 1:

 Input: arr1 = [1,2,3,4,5], arr2 = [1,2,5,7,9], arr3 = [1,3,4,5,8]
 Output: [1,5]
 Explanation: Only 1 and 5 appeared in the three arrays.



 Constraints:

 1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length, arr3.length <= 1000
 1 <= arr1[i], arr2[i], arr3[i] <= 2000
